### Hi, I'm Mengze ðŸ‘‹
I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, working with [Prof. Rob Jackson](https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/) on the Global Carbon Project, particularly global methane budget, and global wetland methane emission and its environmental drivers. Before joining Stanford, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Germany. I received PhD from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. I serve as an Editorial Board Member and Section Lead (Climate Science) for *Communications Earth and Environment* (Springer Nature).

Research interests:
 - Carbon cycle and drivers of greenhouse gases
 - Atmospheric gas compositions, atmosphere-land interactions, atmospheric chemistry
 - Advanced instrumentations and sensors, satellite remote sensing, machine learning
