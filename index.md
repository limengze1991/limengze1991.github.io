I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, working with <a href="https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">Prof. Rob Jackson</a> on the Global Carbon Project, particularly global methane budget, and global wetland methane emission and its environmental drivers. Before joining Stanford, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Germany. I received PhD from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. I serve as an Editorial Board Member and Section Lead (Climate Science) for <a href="https://www.nature.com/commsenv/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Communications Earth and Environment</i></a> (Springer Nature).
