### Hi, I'm Mengze ðŸ‘‹
I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, working with <a href="https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Prof. Rob Jackson</a> on the Global Carbon Project, particularly global methane budget, and global wetland methane emission and its environmental drivers. Before joining Stanford, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Germany. I received PhD from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. I serve as an Editorial Board Member and Section Lead (Climate Science) for <a href="https://www.nature.com/commsenv/" style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Communications Earth and Environment</i></a> (Springer Nature).

Research interests:
 - Carbon cycle and drivers of greenhouse gases
 - Atmospheric gas compositions, atmosphere-land interactions, atmospheric chemistry
 - Advanced instrumentations and sensors, satellite remote sensing, machine learning
