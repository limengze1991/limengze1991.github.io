### Hi, I'm Mengze ðŸ‘‹ÃŸ
I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, working with Prof. Rob Jackson on the Global Carbon Project, particularly global methane budget, and global wetland methane emission and its environmental drivers. Before joining Stanford, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Germany. ÃŸI received PhD from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (2 years and 8 months).

Research interests:
 - Carbon cycle and drivers of greenhouse gases
 - Atmospheric gas compositions, atmosphere-land interactions, atmospheric chemistry
 - Advanced instrumentations and sensors, satellite remote sensing, machine learning
